what is it: ChucK is a general-purpose programming language, intended for 
real-time audio synthesis and graphics/multimedia programming.  It 
introduces a truly concurrent programming model that embeds timing 
directly in the program flow.  Other potentially useful features include 
the ability to write/change programs on-the-fly.
